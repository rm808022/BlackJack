    <string name="supportHelpCenterPA2">\"Split\" - this action is only available if the player\'s
        hand contains two cards of the same value.
        The player doubles their bet, splits their hand in two, and takes two additional cards.
        The two hands are then played independently.</string>
    <string name="supportHelpCenterPA3"> \"Hit\" - the player takes another card.
        This action can be repeated until the value of the hand exceeds 21 points.</string>
    <string name="supportHelpCenterPA4">\"Double\" - the player doubles their bet, takes another card, and stands.</string>
    <string name="supportHelpCenterPA5"> \"Stand\" - the player takes no more cards and keeps their current hand.</string>
    <string name="supportHelpCenterPA6"> If the value of the player\'s hand exceeds 21 points, they lose the round. </string>

    <string name="supportHCDealer1"> Once all players have stood, the dealer turns their face-down card over.</string>
    <string name="supportHCDealer2">If necessary, the dealer can take additional cards until they have 17 or more points.
        If the dealer\'s score exceeds 21, all players who have not gone bust automatically win regardless of their score. </string>

    <string name="supportHCInsurance">Special case: if the dealer has a face-up ace, the players have the option to place an additional
        \"insurance\" bet equal to half of their original bet. Once all players have made a decision, the dealer looks
        at their face-down card. If the dealer has blackjack, a payout of 2:1 is paid on all "insurance" bets.
        If the dealer does not have blackjack, all insurance bets go to the pot and the game continues as usual. </string>

    <string name="supportHCCountingPoints">The following card values are used when counting points: the cards from 2 to 10 are worth
        a number of points equal to the card\'s face value. The card J,Q and K are worth 10 points. Ace is worth 1 or 11 depending
    on which point value prevents the hand from exceeding 21.</string>
